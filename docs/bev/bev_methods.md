# Behavioral Methods
Our behavioral tasks are run on the JATOS platform (typically for online studies) or Python mainly using PsychoPy package (typically for in-lab experiments). 

A step-by-step guide to JATOS can be found [here][1].

Some documentation on PsychoPy can be found [here](https://www.psychopy.org/).


## Example of Behavioral Tasks
### Python tasks
**Effort-Reward Decision-Making**
This task assesses how participants weigh physical or cognitive effort against a potential reward. It provides insight into motivation, decision-making processes, and the valuation of effort in both clinical and non-clinical populations.

**Effort Rating**
Participants perform an action (e.g., squeezing a handgrip) and rate the perceived effort. This task helps calibrate individual effort perception and supports interpretation of effort-based decisions.

### JATOS tasks
**Stop-Signal Task**
A classic measure of response inhibition. Participants respond to go signals and attempt to inhibit their response when a stop signal appears. Useful for assessing cognitive control and impulsivity.

**Option Generation Task**
Participants are prompted with a scenario and asked to generate as many options or solutions as possible. Assesses cognitive flexibility and creative problem-solving.

**N-Back Task**
A working memory task in which participants monitor a sequence of stimuli and respond when the current stimulus matches one shown n steps earlier. Used to measure working memory and cognitive load.

**Rumination Induction**
This paradigm encourages participants to repetitively reflect on negative thoughts or feelings. It’s used to induce and measure rumination, a process central to mood and anxiety disorders.

**Effort Foraging**
Used to study decision-making under effort and reward trade-offs, often used to measure motivation, cost-benefit evaluation, and reward sensitivity.

**Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs)**
We use EMAs to gather real-time data on mood, behavior, and context in participants’ natural environments. These assessments are typically delivered via smartphone notifications multiple times per day.


### Questionnaires
We use a range of standardized self-report questionnaires to assess psychological constructs relevant to our research. All Hebrew questionnaires have been translated from English and validated by two psychiatrists to ensure clinical and technical accuracy.

Some commonly used questionnaires include:

**Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)**
A 7-item scale measuring the severity of generalized anxiety symptoms. Widely used in clinical and research settings.

**Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)**
A 9-item scale for assessing depressive symptom severity, based on DSM diagnostic criteria

**Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)**
A 21-item self-report inventory widely used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. The BDI covers cognitive, emotional, and physical symptoms of depression and is useful for both clinical screening and research purposes. Participants rate the intensity of each symptom over the past two weeks.



**Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) & Apathy Motivation Index (AMI)**
Validated tools to measure apathy and distinguish between different types of motivational deficits. Often used in studies on aging and mental health.

**Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)**
A 14-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess anhedonia. The SHAPS evaluates how much enjoyment individuals derive from typically pleasurable activities, such as hobbies, food, or social interaction. SHAPS is commonly used in both clinical and research settings to measure hedonic tone, particularly in mood and psychiatric disorders.
