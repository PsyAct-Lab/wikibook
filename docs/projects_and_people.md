# People and Projects
### Principal Investigator 

**Dr. Noham Wolpe, MD PhD MRCPsych**

Dr. Wolpe is a senior lecturer at Tel Aviv University and a psychiatrist and visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge. He began his academic career as a Gates Scholar at Cambridge, completing his PhD and postdoctoral work under Professors James Rowe and Daniel Wolpert. 

His research focuses on the interplay between cognition and action, particularly how motivational deficits affect goal-directed behavior in aging and clinical populations.

### Post-Graduate Researchers

**Dr. Daniel Harlev, MD**

Dr. Harlev is a senior psychiatrist in Rambam Mental Health Services. He earned his medical degree from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and is completing his postdoctoral fellowship in the PsyAct Lab.

*Projects:* Examining differences in depression between young and older adults, focusing on patient experiences and underlying mechanisms.

*Methods/Tools:* Effort-Reward Decision-Making, Questionnaires

### MSc Candidates


**Dana Greenberg, MSc Candidate**

Dana is an MSc student in the Sagol Neural Computation and Brain Modeling program. She holds a BSc in Biology and Psychology with a focus on Neuroscience from Tel Aviv University.

*Projects*: The intricate connections between REM sleep dysregulation, depression, and Parkinson's disease. 

*Methods/Tools*: Effort-Reward decision making, Polysomnography, questionnaires, resting EEG

**Denise Jaeschke, MSc Candidate**

Denise is an MSc student at the Sagol International Neuroscience programme. Prior to her work in the lab, Denise completed her BSc in psychology at Ulm University, Germany. You can find her most recent poster on rumination [here].


*Projects*: 

How ruminations in depressive symptoms - the negative repetitive thoughts about one's past experiences - influence cognitive performance and the experience of mental effort.

Developing NLP pipelines to identify the effect of ruminative thought patterns on written text.

*Methods/Tools:* N-Back Task, Rumination Induction, Questionnaires, NLP

**Ido Mellul, MSc Candidate**

Ido is an MSc student at the Sagol neural computation and brain-modelling programme. He has previously completed his BSc in Biology and in Statistics at Tel-Aviv University, and is the lab manager of PsyAct.

*Projects:* How people with ADHD interpret mental effort in comparison to non-ADHD individuals, as well as in using computational tools in order to create new methods of diagnosis.

*Methods/Tools:* Effort Foraging Task, Questionnaires

**Nitsan Schwarz**

Nitsan is an MSc student at the Sagol International Neuroscience programme.  She previously completed her B.S. at the University of California Santa Barbara, and has since worked in women's health and clinical mental health settings. You can find her most recent preprint on menopause [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.22.25322720v1.full.pdf).

*Projects:* Interplay between aspects of psychiatry, physiology and women's health, including menopause and menstrual cycle fluctuations.

*Methods/Tools:* Effort-Reward Decision-Making, Ecological Momentary Assessments, ECG - HRV, SST, Option Generation, Questionnaires

### Researchers and Project Students

**Ela Herzberg, MSc Clinical Neuroscience**

Ela graduated with an MSc from the Sagol Clnical Neuroscience programme. Her general interest is in using computational models for predicting individual differences in mental health. She is currently examining the behavioural and neurophysiological determinants of effort perception across individuals, and their link to mental health.

**Gal Nadler, BSc Computer Science**

Gal is a software developer. Gal previously completed his BSc in computer science at Tel Aviv University, and is currently working on multiple projects in the lab.

*Projects:* API integration, TBS
