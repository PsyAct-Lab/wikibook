# Lab Overview
#### **<br>The Psychiatry in Action lab is part of the Sagol School of Neuroscience and Gray Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences.** ####

Our lab is led by Dr Noham Wolpe, a clinical psychiatrist and researcher. Our research aims to improve understanding of how cognition, mental health, and action interact, both in healthy individuals and in clinical populations. We combine clinical psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience, and computational methods to study these interactions.

Our research focuses on linking subjective experiences to objective, performance-based measures and exploring the physiological mechanisms that mediate this relationship. <br><br>In recent years, we have examined the computational mechanisms of human motivation—a key transdiagnostic construct that is disrupted across many neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression and schizophrenia, and one that remains poorly treated. Our overarching goal is to integrate a transdiagnostic framework with advanced neuroscience methods—computational modelling, neuroimaging and real-time symptom tracking—to develop or repurpose treatments targeting specific motivational symptoms across patient populations.

Our lab takes a **transdiagnostic** approach. This means we look beyond single diagnoses and focus on the core processes, such as motivation, cognition, and emotion, that cut across different mental health conditions. This perspective helps us ask bigger questions and design projects that can be applied broadly—something our students often find both exciting and impactful.

Some terms you may hear us use frequently are:

- **Mental and physical effort**
- **Apathy**
- **Anhedonia**
- **Motivation**
- **Decision making**
- **Reninforcement learning**

**A few examples of some of our ongoing projects:**

- The effect of anticipation on effort perception
- Characterising negative symptoms in schizophrenia (CHANSS)
- The relationship between sleep disorders and motivation in Parkinson's disease
- The mechanisms of depression across the lifespan
- Effect of rumination on mental effort
- Mental and physical effort in ADHD

**Some of our key publications include:**

- [What Is Mental Effort: A Clinical Perspective][1]

- [Depressive symptoms are linked to age-specific neuroanatomical cognitive variations][2]

- [The longitudinal structure of negative symptoms in treatment resistant schizophrenia][3]
