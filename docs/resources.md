# Resources

## Important resources to be familiar with

[RL tutorial](https://www.denoudenlab.org/resources-2) : A common modelling framework often used in the lab.

[Computational neuroscience course](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) : An excellent introductory course on computational neuroscience. Covers topics in mathematics, Python and various modelling approaches used in neuroscience.

[Deep learning course](https://deeplearning.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html) : For those interested in using deep learning methods in the lab.

[Stan documentation and tutorial](https://mc-stan.org/learn-stan/tutorials.html) : Stan is a tool that helps estimate the parameters of a model. In brief, Stan modelling performs full Bayesian inference using methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate a full probability distribution of parameters, while the more 'standard' maximum likelihood (ML) is an estimation method focused on finding a single point estimate that maximises the likelihood of observed data, often used with optimisation algorithms (fminsearch in Matlab or scipy.optimize in Python).

[Visually explained](https://setosa.io/ev/) : A useful way to learn about different statistical and mathematical concepts used in the lab.

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) : Reference software used in the lab. Get in touch with the lab manager to access the lab's paper library on Zotero.

[ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) : AI tool that helps find related papers. Can be synced with your Zotero library.

[Julich Brain Atlas](https://julich-brain-atlas.de/atlas/probabilistic-maps) : A widely used probabilistic brain atlas, especially useful for those using MRI.

[A Beginnerâ€™s Introduction to Mixed Effects Models ](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/2022-06-28-a-beginners-guide-to-mixed-effects-models/) : This is one of the most common 'model free' statistical analyses used in the lab.

[G*Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower) : For power analysis, calculating number of participants required for an experiment. We use either G*Power or 'pwr' package in R.

[AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/index.php) : For pre-registration of your study, typically done prior to recruiting participants or at the pilot stages. If you're not sure why it's important to pre-register your study, check out [this link](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg).

[JATOS](https://www.jatos.org/Installation.html) : JATOS is the backend platform used in our online studies run one [our server](https://jatos.psyact.org/jatos/signin). 

[How to reports stats](../docs/assets/pdfs/reporting_stats1.pdf) : APA guidelines for how to report your statistics in your scientific work.
