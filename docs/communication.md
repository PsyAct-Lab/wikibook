# Communication

Effective communication is essential to collaborative science and a supportive lab culture. In the PsyAct Lab, most, if not all, communication happens on  [Slack][1], our central platform for announcements, coordination, and interaction.

Our lab manager will add you to the Slack lab. 

## Expectations

Please check Slack regularly during lab hours, enable notifications for relevant channels, and use direct messages for one-on-one conversations.

Use public channels when questions or updates could benefit others.

When in doubt, ask! All questions are welcome. 

**Slack Channels**

#general — Lab-wide updates and essential announcements

#talks — Upcoming seminars, journal clubs, and conference alerts

#random — Casual, fun, or non-urgent messages


  **Administrative**
  
For any administrative questions - including study reimbursements, travel, or conference registration - please contact the lab manager for approval before making purchases. 

Reimbursement forms should include clear documentation and be submitted promptly. Most forms needed can be found [here](resources.md)
  
  **Meetings and Lab Space**
  
Meetings with Noham or senior lab members can be booked through direct-message on Slack. 

Our lab members can also be found in the lab office space, School of Medicine 926. Each lab member generally has their own working space and desktop, which will be assigned to you upon lab orientation.

## Lab Booking Communication

With one experiment for running participants, communication is vital to prevent double-booking or interrupting existing studies. To this point, we have an **experiment room calendar** where you are expected to reserve the hours you need for running participants.

**Please only reserve spaces confirmed by your participants** to free up the space for other lab members. More information on running participants can be found [here.](etiquette.md)
