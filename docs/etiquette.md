# Welcome to Your Project

So you're starting your study. Congrats! Research is a repetitive and sometimes lengthy process, and we're here to support you every step of the way. If you are joining as a research assistant rather than leading your own study, you can skip ahead to the **experiment room etiquette** section.

Prior to running participants, you are expected to confirm the following steps with your supervisor. Depending on your study and its complexities, additional steps may be required.


## Prior to Running Study
1. **Design a project proposal.** Your proposal must be approved by your supervisor and should include:

a. Estimated number of participants (n), justified using G*Power [here](resources.md)

b. List of inclusion criteria: [See examples](resources.md)

c. Amount of reimbursement per participant / Project budget

d. Brief literature review and rationale

e. Description of tasks, methods, tools, and questionnaires. You can use our [Proposal Template](resources.md) to stay organized.



2. **Ethics Approval and Consent Forms** 
You must have ethics approval before collecting any data. Ask your supervisor if your project can be added to an existing ethics protocol.
Youâ€™ll also need an IRB-approved consent form. Examples of ethics and consent forms are available [here](resources.md)


3. **Preregistration** Prior to recruiting participants, you must submit your project to a preregistration site. We use [AsPredicted][2]. This submission must be approved by your supervisor. You can find an example of a preregistration submission [here.](resources.md)

4. You must **pilot your study** prior to recruiting participants. Piloting means running your study on 4-5 participants, and checking that the data saves properly to avoid any detrimental mistakes during future participant running.


## Running Your Study

1. **Participant Recruitment:** Finding participants that fit your inclusion/exclusion criteria can be tricky. We recommend posting on **Facebook groups**, **Whatsapp**, and **hanging posters** throughout the university. 

Examples of posters and relevant groups can be found by asking any lab member.

When recruiting participants, please ensure: 

*All recruitment materials follow IRB guidelines*

*Participant data is stored anonymously (no identifying info tied to participant IDs)
Use a centralized form (e.g., Google Form) for large-scale recruitment*


2. **Data Collection and Saving** 

*Save data* after each session, or weekly for longitudinal studies (e.g., EMA).

*Back up your data* to OSF, Google Drive, or a lab-approved platform.

*Organize and document* your data structure as you go (not at the end).

Use version control tools like GitHub for scripts and analysis code.

3. **Data Analysis**
Start cleaning and exploring your data during collection (not afterward).
Discuss your analysis plan early.

## Experiment Room Etiquette

The experiment room is a shared space. As such, we expect the room to remain clean and organized. In addition, reserving space in the experiment room must be done using the **experiment room calendar** (available upon request). Please only reserve hours confirmed by participants, to ensure adequate time for all lab members.

**Computer and Biopac Etiquette:** Please do not make any changes to the experiment room computer, including downloading any programs or restarting the computer. **If you are unsure whether changes can be made, contact a senior lab member.** Inappropriate use of the experiment room computer can lead to program crashing and deletion of data.

## Participant Closing

All participants must sign a payment confirmation form upon compensation. An example of this form can be found [here.](resources.md)

You must submit this form to our centralized payment form area on Slack upon compensation. To receive money for your study, please notify the lab manager one week in advance of estimated participant compensation. 


## Closing Your Project


Once data collection is complete:

**Submit a final report** or presentation to your supervisor.

**Archive all materials** for supervisor access (scripts, preprocessed data, consent forms).

**Ensure all participant data** is anonymized and properly stored.

**Return any physical materials** or equipment to the lab.


## Thesis Writing

For MSc and PhD Students, your thesis is the central part of your degree. We recommend starting your thesis writing early. For MSc students, the thesis must be no longer than 100 pages.

We recommend writing your results section prior to any other section of your thesis.
