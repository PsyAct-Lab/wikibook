# Physiological tools
## Why look at physiology? ##

We use various physiological and neuroimaging tools to better understand how biological mechanisms underlying behaviour. Our physiological toolkit is continuously evolving, but some existing methods include the following.

## The tools ##
**Force dynamometer**: Used in physical effort tasks by measuring the participantâ€™s forces, typically via grip strength. For example, this is used in our effort-reward decision-making tasks. We use [BIOPAC MP160 device](https://www.biopac.com/product-category/research/systems/mp160-systems/).

**Eye-Tracking and pupillometry**: Measures people's gaze metrics while doing a task, including eye gaze position on the screen and changes in pupil dilation. We use [EyeLink 1000 Plus](https://www.sr-research.com/eyelink-1000-plus/).

**Indirect calorimetry**: Measures [metabolic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_calorimetry). We use [Calibre Biometrics](https://calibrebio.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqPY9lOVoFoNKmpRhEHIyxqt6lnC0mcqJ3mYxcm8X-WPyuSj3bg).

**Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Records electrical activity from the scalp during tasks or during rest ('resting state'). We use a [wet Brain Products EEG system](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/actichamp_plus/) in the lab. We also use a [dry EEG system](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/actichamp_plus/) for remote at-home testing
and portable EEG devices for mobile or at-home settings.

**Electrocardiography (ECG)**: We use this mainly to examine changes in heart rate or in heart rate variability (HRV), which is a marker of autonomic nervous system function and stress regulation. We use [BIOPAC MP36](https://www.biopac.com/wp-content/uploads/MP36-MP45.pdf) in the lab.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: We use structural and functional MRI methods in the lab. This is mainly done through the [MRI testing centre at Tel Aviv University](https://mri.tau.ac.il/).
