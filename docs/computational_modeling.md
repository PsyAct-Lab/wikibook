# Computational Modeling
We use various computational methods to model and analyze data, including reinforcement learning (RL) models, Bayesian models, value-based decision making models, graph theory and network analyses. <br>Please read more about these methods, check out the [Resources page](https://osf.io/7dq3n/wiki/Resources/).


#### Task and Data Analysis Code

The lab has a [joint GitHub repository](https://github.com/PsyAct-Lab). Adopting an [open transparent science](https://www.cos.io/open-science) approach, we publish the data and code we use for papers in this repository or through the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/dashboard).
