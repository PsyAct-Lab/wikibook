# Onboarding: Welcome to the lab!
As a new member of our lab, we understand that joining a new space can be overwhelming. This guide is meant to serve as a checklist of what you can expect during your onboarding process.

As you go through this list, remember that all questions are welcome. We are here to welcome you and help you learn!

## Onboarding includes...

### Lab buddy

You will be paired with a senior lab member to show you around and answer any questions. Reach out to them at any time. This is what they're here for!

### Administrative Set-Up

Send the website's maintainer (currently Hiddai) a **photo and short bio** about yourself for the [lab's People page](https://psyact.org/people).

You will be given access to key lab tools and platforms, and a key to the lab office (Medicine 926) if you are a graduate researcher.

### Research Set-Up
We highly recommend you go through the list of resources in the [Resources page](resources.md) and make yourself familiar with the methods and tools relevant for you.

### Communication

Most communication will be over Slack. You are expected to be up-to-date on Slack general and individual messages.

Direct message will be used, as well as other channels. See more [here](communication.md)
        
### Study Etiquette: 

[Click here](etiquette.md) for a guide on setting up your study and using the experiment room. 

You are expected to know etiquette for setting up and using the experiment room prior to designing your experiment, or to running participants if you are a research assistant. This may include additional ethics forms and university approval, so please plan ahead time-wise.

### Our Onboarding Philosophy

We understand that joining a research lab involves a steep learning curve. We value all skill levels and believe that both technical and interpersonal skills are essential for good science.

We encourage you to take initiative, ask questions, and be open about what you need to succeed. 


# What We Expect of You

We strive to create an open, collaborative environment for all lab members. As such, we hold weekly meetings and communicate regularly. You are expected to:

**Attend weekly lab meetings** that are held each Wendsday at 12:30PM (But might change occasioanly, so stay updated in Slack).

**Communicate immediately** about project mistakes. Mistakes are part of the learning process. Make sure to contact your supervisor or other members of the lab immediately when mistakes occur, so we can solve them together.

**Ask questions** when you are unsure of the next steps for your project.

**Be proactive** in your research. For MSc students, these two years fly quickly - while we will have check-in meetings, you are expected to know the deadline for thesis submission and prepare accordingly.

# What to Expect of Us

**Mentoring** from Noham and graduate students: Frequent meetings, both academically and personally. We value not just good research but also good relationships. If in doubt - reach out.

**Feedback** about your project and progress, including project proposal, analysis and interpretation.


**Connections** to other researchers, as well as scholarships, conferences, and letters of recommendation.

Part of our lab values include curiosity and collaboration with other labs. We are more than happy to connect with other labs to integrate ideas or ask questions about topics that we are less familiar with.
