# Psychiatry in Action's wiki

Welcome to our new wiki page repo. Here you will be able to add your work to the website using jupyter notebooks and markdown files.

# How it works

We use Github Pages for the hosting of the wiki, where we host the website.
Upon changes to the repo, the website automatically builds itself and publishes itself.

Files that are not relevant to the website can be added here, for example datasets. The wiki rebuilds itself only when changes to the docs folder in the main branch changes.

The gh-pages branch is where the actual source of the website lives. It should be automatically built, so refrain from touching it.
